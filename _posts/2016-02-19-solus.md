**Updated for Solus 1.2** on Dec'16. 

Solus is a Linux operating system and I must say this one is just awesome!
I personally prefer the MATE edition of Solus.

Here's what I was looking for and why Solus meets my requirement perfectly.

## Good looks combined with stability and performance!

I won't be reviewing this OS, for that you can checkout Youtube which has a fairly good set of [reviews about this OS](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Solus+1.2.1+review).

This is more about setting up Solus so you can use it as your development machine of choice.

A fresh installation of Solus Mate 1.2 takes less than 300MB RAM.
Something you may get with Xfce or baseline Arch installation.

## //TODO After installing Solus 1.2

You definitely want to check for updates and apply them using the Software Center.

System -> Administration -> Software Center

The [Solus wiki](https://wiki.solus-project.com/3rdParty) has some useful links about installing various softwares. Use that for more software bundles that you may need.
I picked few and added few of my own here.

### Make it user friendly
Setup **Flash**
{% highlight bash %}
sudo eopkg install flash-player-nonfree
{% endhighlight %}


Get **Microsoft fonts**
{% highlight bash %}
sudo eopkg bi --ignore-safety https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solus-project/3rd-party/master/desktop/font/mscorefonts/pspec.xml
sudo eopkg it mscorefonts*.eopkg
{% endhighlight %}


Setup **Google chrome**
{% highlight bash %}
sudo eopkg bi --ignore-safety https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solus-project/3rd-party/master/network/web/browser/google-chrome-stable/pspec.xml
sudo eopkg it google-chrome-*.eopkg
{% endhighlight %}


Setup **WPS Office**
{% highlight bash %}
sudo eopkg bi --ignore-safety https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solus-project/3rd-party/master/office/wps-office/pspec.xml
sudo eopkg it wps-office*.eopkg
{% endhighlight %}

### Make it developer friendly
**Setup Java**
Download the latest JDK from Oracle site and put it under /opt.
{% highlight bash %}
tar xf jdk-8u112-linux-x64.tar.gz
mv jdk1.8.0_112 /opt/
ln -svf /opt/jdk1.8.0_112/bin/java /usr/bin/java
ln -svf /opt/jdk1.8.0_112/bin/javac /usr/bin/javac
{% endhighlight %}

If you use apache-maven then I suggest you download maven and put it under /opt.

Maven is present in the repository but it will pull openjdk as well.

[Download maven](http://www-eu.apache.org/dist/maven/maven-3/3.3.9/binaries/apache-maven-3.3.9-bin.tar.gz)

To get both maven commands and java working create a file env.sh as shown below:

{% highlight bash %}
cat /usr/share/defaults/etc/profile.d/env.sh 
export JAVA_HOME=/opt/jdk1.8.0_112
export M2_HOME=/opt/apache-maven-3.3.9

export PATH=$PATH:$M2_HOME/bin:$JAVA_HOME/bin
{% endhighlight %}


**Setup Sublime Text and Visual Studio Code** editors and some nice fonts for source code
{% highlight bash %}
sudo eopkg it sublime-text-3-3126-3-1-x86_64.eopkg
sudo eopkg install vscode
sudo eopkg install source-code-pro
{% endhighlight %}


Setup **Git**
{% highlight bash %}
sudo eopkg install git
{% endhighlight %}


Setup **rsync** if you wish to do any synchronization of data between drives (local/remote)
{% highlight bash %}
sudo eopkg install rsync
{% endhighlight %}


Solus is mean't for desktop users and is a fairly new distribution. This is good and bad depending on which camp you belong to. 
As a end user you should be just fine, but as a developer you may need to install certain packages which may not be available in the repositories.

A good choice no matter which personal OS you use is to make use of Virtual Machines or Containers such as docker.
This allows for doing experiments without breaking your personal OS, by polluting it with various libraries or packages.

VirtualBox and Vagrant are good choices, but I prefer docker these days.

### Setup **docker**
{% highlight bash %}
sudo eopkg install docker
sudo systemctl enable docker && sudo systemctl start docker
{% endhighlight %}

Add your user to docker group so you need not use "sudo" all the time for docker commands:
{% highlight bash %}
sudo usermod -aG docker prashantp
{% endhighlight %}


Setup docker compose.
docker-compose installation didn't work for me as is, thus I had to install few additional dependencies to get it working.
{% highlight bash %}
sudo eopkg install docker-compose pyyaml python-jsonschema
{% endhighlight %}

Now, if you wanted MySQL running locally using docker then here's how you do that.

### Install **MySQL using docker**
{% highlight bash %}
docker pull mysql/mysql-server
docker run --name mysqldock -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret -d mysql/mysql-server
{% endhighlight %}


*Connect to MySQL instance*
{% highlight bash %}
docker exec -it mysqldock mysql -uroot -p
{% endhighlight %}


*Shutdown MySQL docker instance and clean up.*
{% highlight bash %}
docker stop mysqldock
docker rm mysqldock
{% endhighlight %}

*That's it. You should now have a nice distro all up and running!*
