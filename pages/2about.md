            </h2>
            <p>
            Been developing software since 2002 and still loving it. Professionally I have over a decade of experience in building Real World projects, using Java SE and EE along with Open source technologies put-together. Having worked for large coporations and start-ups, my goal is to use my learnings to build solutions that are both robust and a pleasure to work on!
            </p>
            <p>
            I spend most of my time hacking into frameworks, libraries, Linux and exploring opportunities to adopt and leverage them. When I have time to kill, I love to solve the rubik's cube and spend time with my two little daughters. I have built this site as means for sharing my thoughts and learnings as knowledge articles.
            </p>
             <p class="not-important">
             I maintain the site using Jekyll and GitHub pages.
