> Been developing softwares since 2002 and still loving it. Professionally I have over 10 years experience and I consider myself a coding architect who builds enterprise scale software using Java, JEE & Open source technologies 
put together. <br/> <br/>
I spend most of my time hacking into frameworks, libraries, Linux and exploring opportunities to adopt and leverage them.
When I have time to kill, I love to solve the rubik's cube and spend time with my two little daughters.<br/>
I have built this site as I wanted to share my thoughts and learnings as knowledge articles.<br/> I maintain the site using Jekyll and GitHub pages.
